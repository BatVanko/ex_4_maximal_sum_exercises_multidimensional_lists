# ex_4_maximal_sum_exercises_multidimensional_lists

Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix's dimensions and finds the 3x3 square with a maximum sum of its elements. There will be no case with two or more 3x3 squares with equal maximal sum.
Input
•	On the first line, you will receive the rows and columns in the format "{rows} {columns}" – integers in the range [1, 20]
•	On the following lines, you will receive each row with its columns - integers, separated by a single space in the range [-20, 20]
Output
•	On the first line, print the maximum sum of the elements in the 3x3 square in the format "Sum = {sum}"
•	On the following 3 lines, print each element of the found submatrix, separated by a single space

Input

4 5
1 5 5 2 4
2 1 4 14 3
3 7 11 2 8
4 8 12 16 4


Output

Sum = 75
1 4 14
7 11 2
8 12 16
